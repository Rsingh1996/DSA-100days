What is a Linked List?
A linked list is a data structure where each element (called a node) contains:

The data (value)
A reference (pointer) to the next node in the list
Unlike arrays, linked lists do not store elements in contiguous memory locations.

Difference Between Array and Linked List
Feature	Array	Linked List
Memory	Contiguous block	Nodes scattered, linked by pointers
Access	Fast (O(1) by index)	Slow (O(n), must traverse)
Insertion/Deletion	Slow (O(n), need to shift elements)	Fast (O(1) at head/tail if pointer known)
Size	Fixed or needs resizing	Dynamic, grows/shrinks easily

Types of Linked Lists
1. Singly Linked List
Each node points to the next node.
Can only move forward.
Node structure:

+------+------+
| data | next | --> next node
+------+------+
2. Doubly Linked List
Each node points to the next and previous node.
Can move forward and backward.
Node structure:

+------+-------+------+
| prev | data  | next |
+------+-------+------+

Key Operations

Insertion
At Head (beginning):
Create new node.
Point its next to current head.
Update head to new node.
Time: O(1)

At Tail (end):
Traverse to last node (unless you keep a tail pointer).
Set last node’s next to new node.
Time: O(n) (O(1) if tail pointer is maintained)

Deletion
At Head:
Move head to next node.
Time: O(1)

At Tail or Middle:
Traverse to node before the one to delete.
Update its next to skip the deleted node.
Time: O(n)

Time Complexity Table
Operation	Array	Linked List (Singly)
Access by index	O(1)	O(n)
Insert at head	O(n)	O(1)
Insert at tail	O(1)*	O(n) (O(1)**)
Delete at head	O(n)	O(1)
Delete at tail	O(1)*	O(n)
Search	O(n)	O(n)
* O(1) for dynamic arrays if there is space; otherwise O(n) due to resizing.
** O(1) for linked list if you keep a tail pointer.

Diagram of a Singly Linked List
+-----+------+    +-----+------+    +-----+------+
|  5  |  o-->|--->|  8  |  o-->|--->| 12  | null|
+-----+------+    +-----+------+    +-----+------+
 head           node 2             node 3 (tail)
Each box is a node.
Each arrow is a pointer to the next node.
The last node points to null (end of list).

Notes & Review
Difference between arrays and linked lists
Arrays: Fast access, slow insert/delete (except at end), fixed size.
Linked lists: Slow access, fast insert/delete at head, dynamic size.

Time complexity for insertion, deletion, search
Insertion at head: O(1)
Insertion at tail: O(n) (O(1) with tail pointer)
Deletion at head: O(1)
Deletion at tail/middle: O(n)
Search: O(n)
