Prefix Sum
What is it?
Imagine you have a row of coins, and you want to know how much money you have if you pick up the first few coins, or any group of coins in a row. Instead of counting them every time, you keep a notebook where you write down the total after each coin you pick up. This notebook is your prefix sum array.

In programming:
A prefix sum array helps you quickly find the sum of any part of an array, without adding up the numbers every time.

Why use it?
Speed: If you need to answer many “what’s the sum from position X to Y?” questions, prefix sum lets you do it instantly.
Efficiency: Saves time, especially for big arrays or lots of queries.
How does it work? (The Formula)
Let’s say your array is called arr.

Start with a new array called prefix.
The first value is 0 (for easier math).
For each position i,
prefix[i] = prefix[i-1] + arr[i-1] (if prefix starts at 0 index) or
prefix[i] = prefix[i-1] + arr[i] (if prefix starts at 1 index)
Example:

let arr = [2, 4, 6, 8];
let prefix = [0]; // Start with 0 for easier math

for (let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
  prefix.push(prefix[i] + arr[i]);
}
// prefix = [0, 2, 6, 12, 20]

Step by step:

prefix[0] = 0
prefix[1] = prefix[0] + arr[0] = 0 + 2 = 2
prefix[2] = prefix[1] + arr[1] = 2 + 4 = 6
prefix[3] = prefix[2] + arr[2] = 6 + 6 = 12
prefix[4] = prefix[3] + arr[3] = 12 + 8 = 20
So, prefix = [0, 2, 6, 12, 20]

How do you use it? (Range Sum Queries)
If you want the sum from index l to r (inclusive),
Sum = prefix[r+1] - prefix[l]

Example:
Sum from index 1 to 3 (4 + 6 + 8):

prefix[4] - prefix[1] = 20 - 2 = 18
Applications
Range sum queries: Quickly find the sum of any part of an array.
Subarray problems: Find subarrays with a certain sum, or check if a subarray sum is even/odd, etc.
Visual Analogy
Think of prefix sum as a running total in your notebook. If you want to know how much you collected between two points, just subtract the earlier total from the later one!


Sliding Window
What is it?
Imagine you have a long row of windows on a train. You can only look through a few windows at a time (say, 3 in a row). As the train moves, your “window” slides forward, always looking at the next group of 3.

In programming:
A sliding window is a way to look at a part of an array (a “window”) and move that window across the array to process or check something about each group.

Types of Sliding Window
1. Fixed-size Window
The window always covers the same number of elements.
Example: Always looking at 3 numbers at a time.
Use case:
Find the maximum sum of any 3 consecutive numbers.

Step-by-step Example:

Let’s use arr = [1, 3, 2, 5, 1, 1, 2, 3] and window size k = 3.

First window: 1 + 3 + 2 = 6
Next window: 3 + 2 + 5 = 10
Next window: 2 + 5 + 1 = 8
Next window: 5 + 1 + 1 = 7
Next window: 1 + 1 + 2 = 4
Next window: 1 + 2 + 3 = 6
Maximum sum is 10 (from [3, 2, 5]).

Code:
let arr = [1, 3, 2, 5, 1, 1, 2, 3];
let k = 3;
let maxSum = 0;

// Calculate sum of first window
let windowSum = 0;
for (let i = 0; i < k; i++) windowSum += arr[i];
maxSum = windowSum;

// Slide the window
for (let i = k; i < arr.length; i++) {
  windowSum += arr[i] - arr[i - k];
  if (windowSum > maxSum) maxSum = windowSum;
}
console.log(maxSum); // Output: 10

2. Variable-size Window
The window can grow or shrink depending on the problem.
Example: Find the smallest subarray with a sum at least K.
Step-by-step Example:

Let’s use arr = [2, 1, 5, 2, 3, 2] and target sum K = 7.

Start with left and right pointers at the beginning.
Expand the window by moving right, adding numbers.
When the sum is at least K, try to shrink the window from the left to find the smallest length.

Code:
let arr = [2, 1, 5, 2, 3, 2];
let K = 7;
let minLength = Infinity, windowSum = 0, left = 0;

for (let right = 0; right < arr.length; right++) {
  windowSum += arr[right];
  while (windowSum >= K) {
    minLength = Math.min(minLength, right - left + 1);
    windowSum -= arr[left];
    left++;
  }
}
console.log(minLength);


Applications
Subarray sum problems: Find the max or min sum in a window.
Max/min in window: Find the largest or smallest value in every window.
String problems: Find the longest substring with certain properties.
Visual Analogy
Think of the sliding window as a magnifying glass moving over a row of numbers, always focusing on a group, and then sliding forward to the next group.
